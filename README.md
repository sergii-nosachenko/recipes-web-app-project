## Roadmap

- Setup your development environments for client and server
- Decide if you will work with monorepo or multi-repo ([article #1](https://geekflare.com/code-repository-strategies/), [article #2](https://kinsta.com/blog/monorepo-vs-multi-repo/#monorepo-vs-multirepo-how-to-choose))
- Initialize empty frontend project
- Initialize empty backend project
- Create a GitHub repo(s) and connect it with your project
- Install all necessary dependencies
- Configure typescript, linter, prettier, etc
- Create a dummy screen with the `Hello world!` text and run it. Check if all works correctly.
- Choose a template, icons, color theme, and APIs (read next chapter)
- Register and get API keys. Test APIs at their playgrounds or use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Write a step-by-step plan for your development. **Add a realistic deadline to your calendar!** It will take 2-3 working days to complete this task.
- Start developing, feature-by-feature, commit-by-commit (remember, you need to have a nice commit history!).
- Test your application
- When completed, create an extended `readme.md` file ([example](https://gist.github.com/solaryasha/0fb46a864b490afd618f2c4751a65041), [constructor](https://readme.so/))
- Deploy your project so it can be viewed online (Expo provides you with a great tool to deploy)
- Ask the mentor to give you feedback
- Add project to your portfolio
- Profit!
