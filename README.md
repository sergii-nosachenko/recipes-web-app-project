## Roadmap

- Setup your development environments for client and server
- Decide if you will work with monorepo or multi-repo ([article #1](https://geekflare.com/code-repository-strategies/), [article #2](https://kinsta.com/blog/monorepo-vs-multi-repo/#monorepo-vs-multirepo-how-to-choose))
- Initialize empty frontend project using:
  - [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) (* if you have chosen Next.js)
- Initialize empty backend project
- Create a GitHub repo(s) and connect it with your project
- Install all necessary dependencies
- Configure typescript, linter, prettier, etc
- Create a dummy frontend page with the `Hello world!` text and run it. Check if all works correctly.
- Create a dummy backend endpoint with the `Hello world!` text and request it. Check if all works correctly.
- Choose UI library and API (read next chapter)
- Test API endpoints directly or use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Write a step-by-step plan for your development. **Add a realistic deadline to your calendar!** It will take 3-5 working days to complete this task.
- Start developing, feature-by-feature, commit-by-commit (remember, you need to have a nice commit history!).
- Test your application
- When completed, create an extended `readme.md` file ([example](https://gist.github.com/solaryasha/0fb46a864b490afd618f2c4751a65041), [constructor](https://readme.so/)) for both frontend and backend parts
- Deploy your project so it can be viewed online
- Ask the mentor to give you feedback
- Add project to your portfolio
- Profit!

## API

You can choose between two APIs:
- [Meals](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
- [Cocktails](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

You choice will determine what your app will be:
- Cooking app
- Party app

## App structure wireframe

You can find basic app design [here](). It doesn't have styles and strict limitations - use it only as reference. Overall look of your app depends on UI library and your own ideas.
